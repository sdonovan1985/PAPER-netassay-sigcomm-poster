\section{Progress and Future Work}
%Work on \system{} is ongoing. Design work and implementation of specific modules, including the DNS flow classifier, are complete. Implementation is in progress. Further simplification, such as simplifying the policy in the introduction to be a single line, is desired.

%%There are some inherent limitations, but will be resolved thanks to progress on other project. In particular, SDX is limited to a single switch right now, however this may be a minor issue due to ongoing SDX development.

%%Of note is that the DNS flow classifier is the only module that does packet inspection.

%Future work, beyond finishing currently planned work, is to proactively perform DNS look ups from various public DNS sources in order to get a broader data set. While conflicts between the handlers' policies are unlikely, handling conflicts needs to be addressed in the future. Along the same lines, in cases where bandwidth is being counted, preventing `double counting' between the two handlers is also necessary.

%Additionally, incorporating this system into an Internet Exchange Point, particularly in the form of SDX~\cite{sdx}, is a natural next step.

Work on \system{} is ongoing. Design work on the two handlers is complete, with implementation and testing ongoing. Triggered behaviors is the current area of focus.  Further simplification, such as simplifying the policy in the introduction to be a single line, is desired.

Future work, beyond finishing implementation and testing, primarily focuses on optimization. Proactive DNS look ups from various public DNS sources provides a broader data set. Additionally, handling conflicts between handlers' policies needs to be addressed, both with data flows and potential `double counting' between multiple handlers.  

Further work incorporating this system into an Internet Exchange Point, particularly in the form of SDX~\cite{sdx}, is a natural next step
